name: libxslt
summary: Single-line elevator pitch for your amazing snap under 79 chars.
description: |
  This is libxslt's description. You have a paragraph or two to tell
  the most important story about your snap. Keep it under 100 words though,
  we live in tweetspace and your description wants to look good in the snap
  store.

# The path of icon to represent the snap, relative to the source tree directory
# Only PNG or SVG image is supported, dimension must be greater than 256x256px
icon: snap/gui/libxslt.adapted.png

# Version string just for humans, typically '1.2+git' or '1.3.2'
# The wrapping single quotes are often required to avoid the version string
# being accidentally interpreted as a YAML non-string(like '1', '1.2').

version: determined-by-version-script

# (OPTIONAL) The version string can also be dynamically determined via scripting
# , in this case the value of the `version` key will be ignored (but the key is
# still required).
# NOTE: The resulting version string cannot be longer than 32 characters

# Security confinement
# Use `devmode` to getting started
# Flip to `strict` once you have the right plugs and slots,
# or `classic` once you determine that strict confinement is not currently possible
confinement: strict

# Snap Grade
# Use `devel` to getting started
# Flip to `stable` once you determine that the snap is matured, only `stable` grade
# snaps can be promoted to `candidate` and `stable` channels
grade: stable

# Refer the following documentation for asserting interface plugs and slots in a security confined snap:

# Apps that are exposed by the snap package
# If the _app_name_ is identical with the _snap_name_ it can be directly run

# via `_snap_name_._app_name_` or `snap run _snap_name_._app_name_`

    # The command to run the application, the base command should be an *relative path* to an executable file rooted from the `prime` directory (for `classic` confinement compatiblity, where command search PATHs under $SNAP isn't set for library compatiblity reasons).  The arguments are usually other launchers' *absolute path* rooted from the $SNAP environment variable that are *stacked over* previous ones to consolidate their runtime environment modifications.
    # NOTE: The right angle bracket at the beginning of the value of the `command` keyword starts a YAML folded style block scalar, refer the following spec document for more info: http://yaml.org/spec/1.2/spec.html#id2796251
