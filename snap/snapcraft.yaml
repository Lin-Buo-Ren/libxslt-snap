title: The XSLT C library for GNOME
summary: XSLT C library developed for the GNOME project
description: |
  Libxslt is the XSLT C library developed for the GNOME project. XSLT itself is a an XML language to define transformation for XML. Libxslt is based on libxml2 the XML C library developed for the GNOME project. It also implements most of the EXSLT set of processor-portable extensions functions and some of Saxon's evaluate and expressions extensions.

  People can either embed the library in their application or use xsltproc the command line processing tool. This library is free software and can be reused in commercial applications.

  This is NOT an official distribution of libxslt, for any issue regarding using this snap please refer to the issue tracker:
